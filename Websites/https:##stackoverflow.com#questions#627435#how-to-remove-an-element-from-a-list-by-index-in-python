n  whether list deque    jfs Nov                Yes  j f sebastian  you re correct  I subsequently found deque improves scalability insertions  lookups  O     deletions  I deleted incorrect answer  However I thought  list  deletions by index lookup followed delete  and internal memory reallocation   surely they re O    O n   Deletions by value indeed O n  since involve traversal    smci Nov                smci  Python list array based  delete item middle  move items right remove gap O n  time operation  deque   provides efficient operations ends provide O    insertions lookups deletions middle    jfs Sep             J F Sebastian  cPython implementation  yes  thanks correcting me  Strictly language spec doesn t specify implement list  alternative implementations could choose use

defined objects support pop  yet define   getitem                                     index       Only Positive index       a  index    a index                          Note  Please note method modify list inplace like pop del  It instead makes two copies lists   one start index without   a  index    one index till last element   a index         creates new list object adding both  This reassigned list variable      The old list object hence dereferenced hence garbage collected   provided original list object referenced variable   This makes method inefficient also produce undesirable side effects   especially variables point original list object remains un modified   Thanks  MarkDickinson pointing     This Stack Overflow answer explains concept slicing  Also note works positive indices  While using objects    getitem   method must defined importantly   add   method must defined return object containing items operands  In essence works object whose class definition like   class foo object   def   init   self  items   self items   items def   getitem   self  index   return foo self items index   def   add   self  right   return foo  self items   right items   This works list defines   getitem     add   methods  Comparison three ways terms efficiency  Assume following predefined     range     index     The del object index  method  By far efficient method  Works objects define   del   method  The disassembly follows   Code  def del method    global global index del a index  Disassembly       LOAD GLOBAL    a    LOAD GLOBAL    index    DELETE SUBSCR   This line deletes item   LOAD CONST    None     RETURN VALUE None pop method  Less efficient del method  Used need get deleted item  Code  def pop method    global global index a pop index  Disassembly       LOAD GLOBAL    a    LOAD ATTR    pop    LOAD GLOBAL    index    CALL FUNCTION      POP TOP    LOAD CONST    None     RETURN VALUE The slice add method  The least efficient  Code  def slice method

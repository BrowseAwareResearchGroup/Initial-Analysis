Cheung  Jayant Krishnamurthy  Luke Zettlemoyer ACL      We present approach rapidly easily build natural language interfaces databases new domains  whose performance improves time based user feedback  requires minimal intervention  To achieve this  adapt neural sequence models map utterances directly SQL full expressivity  bypassing intermediate meaning representations  These models immediately deployed online solicit feedback real users flag incorrect queries  Finally  popularity SQL facilitates gathering annotations incorrect predictions using crowd  directly used improve models  This complete feedback loop  without intermediate representations database specific engineering  opens new ways building high quality semantic parsers  Experiments suggest approach deployed quickly new
